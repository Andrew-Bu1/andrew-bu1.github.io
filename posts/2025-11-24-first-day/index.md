# Work

This morning I woke up at 6:00 AM but i was feeling a bit tired, so i took the phone and watching facebook reels, thinking it would make my day better, but it didn't. It was a waste of time. So i went to work quite late , but when i arrived at work, the employees were already there and i was the last one to arrive. But what made my day, was when i talked with minh (my colleague) and we had a great conversation about our future plans for genAI team. I had a talk with my manager about the AI Factory stuff, he asked if all of my team would go to the AI Factory in EDA, but all of us decided to stay, and find way to apply genAI in our daily work more effectively. I also thought a bit about my new project ideas, and i decided to talk with my teams, and share my ideas with them. It is a Project for Testing from api, data test, and even LLM. We will use LLM to generate testcases for our API, tools to generate datatest, and run workflow for ETL, and even use LLM to test our LLM models.

## Planning

From now on, i will focus on improving my problem-solving skills by learning new technologies, practicing leetcode, and learning AI. To build Model from scratch, i will start with simple first, but i also want to study again the theory or algorithms of how things work, and how to apply them in real-world scenarios. For example, How Internet works, Database, Operating System, and how they work together? I want to become a true problem solver in IT. Can't wait to start my journey to contribute to the world of OSS.
